  # happy path testing seems impossible due to no discernable output that 
  # indicates that an existing valid stack is being applied during the push.
  # So, instead we test by specifying a valid stack (`cf stacks`) that we 
  # actually don't have any compatible cells for in our ci environment (such 
  # as 'windows').  In this scenario the push will fail, but we can still 
  # query the cloud controller for the app's stack for our assertion.
